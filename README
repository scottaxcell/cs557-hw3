Notes:
======
* I built this fdscan program on top of the fsniffer I built in homework 2.

* Everything appears to be working correctly. I tested the scanner detection on a number
of nmap capture files I found on the wireshark wiki. See the link in the website resources above.

* I was successfull at building and running on the Ubuntu1404-64-STDNDN image in DETER.
